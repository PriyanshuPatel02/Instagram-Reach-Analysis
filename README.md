# Instagram-Reach-Analysis

I have been researching Instagram reach for a long time now. Every time I post on my Instagram account, I collect data on how well the post reach after a week. That helps in understanding how Instagram’s algorithm is working. If you want to analyze the reach of your Instagram account, you have to collect your data manually as there are some APIs, but they don’t work well. So it’s better to collect your Instagram data manually.

If you are a data science student and want to learn Instagram reach analysis using Python, you can use the data I have collected from my Instagram account.  I will take you through the task of Instagram Reach Analysis and Prediction with Machine Learning using Python.
